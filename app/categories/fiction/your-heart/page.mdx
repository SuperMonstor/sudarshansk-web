I didn't know what to say. I could barely hold myself together. My hands were shivering, and though I'm not usually someone who gets very emotional, tears streamed down my face. I didn't care anymore.

"I know it's probably good for us to break up.. but.. I don't know. I just love you so much"

---

"The first time I met her seemed so insignificant in the moment. How could I have ever known? I was running in the park and we just... met. The second I saw her, I was struck.

The first time she came over to my place, I was showing her around when she noticed a projector I'd just purchased.

'Wait. You have to see this,' I said, extremely proud of my ability to purchase something that cool to adorn my apartment.

"You're gonna love this," I promised, dimming the lights and filling the room with soft music as colors bloomed across the blank canvas of my wall.

She stood transfixed, her gaze slowly drifting from the swirling patterns to find mine. "Can I?" she asked, her voice barely audible.

'Yeah, sure.'

I don't even remember what she played because all I can recollect from that moment was her reaching out her hand, inviting me to dance. I'm not really much of a dancer, but in that moment, I would've trusted her with the world.

She held my hand, pulled me closer, and we danced. She could tell very early on that I don't usually do this and was quite nervous, and she couldn't help but smile.

'This is so beautiful,' she said, as we held each other close, faces inches apart from each other."

We laughed, we danced. Little did she know that in that moment she had my heart.

A couple days later we met again. This time we were sitting together on the couch, holding each other tight. Things just progressed naturally—I didn't even know how we'd gotten there.

'I'm scared to kiss you. I don't know why,' she whispered.

I just pulled her closer, our eyes meeting. I knew she was ready. Our lips touched, my heart pounding out of my chest, and it all just felt so right.

The room blurred, and all I knew was the warmth of her lips—like the world had tipped sideways.

---

One day she called me, absolutely terrified. She didn't know what to do, and didn't know if everything was ever going to be okay again.

She hadn't slept in three days.

I hadn't slept much either and could not bear the thought of what she was going through.

But finally, we got some restitution. They were stable. They were going to make it.

"It's okay, it's gonna be alright," I told her. I could tell from the look on her eyes that she was still extremely anxious. The last couple days had taken a massive toll on her.

"You're so strong. Just take my hand, and hold it tight."

"You're always going to be there right?"

"Always. I will protect you from everything. I'll keep you safe and warm. I'll always be here, don't cry."

---

What am I even supposed to do now? I'd planned my entire life around her. I couldn't imagine living without her.

It's so hard to go to bed alone at night.

The silence when I go to bed crushes me.

The emptiness of my phone screen every morning haunts me.

The cold loneliness of being sick with no one to bring soup or rest a cool hand on my forehead destroys me.

Does she think of me? Has someone else already taken my place in her bed, her mind, her heart?

I can't bear imagining her moving forward while I'm frozen in this moment of loss. Did everything we shared mean as little to her as it meant everything to me?

I had the rest of the summer ahead of me, all the time in the world but nothing to fill it with. We were supposed to go for painting classes, try wine, travel the world.

I opened up my phone, and drafted one last message. I swore this was going to be the last one.

"I love you so fucking much. I don't think I realize just how much I miss you sometimes"

Message sent. One tick.

One tick.

One tick.

One tick.

One last tear. One final surrender. This time, I know it's over.
